### What is Gremlint?
Gremlint is a code formatter which parses Gremlin queries and rewrites them to adhere to certain styling rules.

### But why?
- To make Gremlin queries more readable
- To make your queries more beautiful
- Because I have never found a good Gremlin style guide

### How do I use it?
Gremlint is simply an HTML document. You can download it and open it in a browser, or simply paste all the code into a JavaScript compatible HTML editor.
